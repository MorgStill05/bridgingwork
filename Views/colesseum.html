				The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city Rome, Italy. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in 72AD and was completed in 80AD under his successor and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian. The three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).
